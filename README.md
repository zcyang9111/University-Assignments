# University-Assignments
These are my assignments for a course named Using Machine Learning Tools.

## Assignment 1 
**Objective**:<br> 
Predicted bike rental demand in Seoul by analysing data from 2017-2018.<br>

**Results**:
* Compared model using linear regression and support vector regression, and found the better model based on root square mean error (RMSE).<br>
* Earned grades 17/20(HD).<br>


## Assignment 2
**Objective**:<br> 
Classified image data to determine presence of breast cancer in patients using Wisconsin breast cancer data set.<br>

**Results**:
* Compared model using SGD, SVM and Decision Tree classifiers based on area under the curve (AUC) for the validation set.<br>
* The best model I trained had an 85% true positive rate, which did not meet the client's requirement that the true positive rate is over 90%.<br>
* Earned grades 26.4/30(HD).<br>


## Assignment 3
**Objective**:<br> 
Classified images of hands in poses that correspond to letters in American Sign Language using CNN and DNN.<br>

**Results**:
* Explored model using different hidden sizes, learning rates and optimizers based on accuracy for the validation set.<br>
* The client required that the median accuracy would exceed 94% overall and better than 85% for every individual letter. The model I trained had 0.99 median accuracy, and tree letters did not meet the 85% individual accuracy.<br>
* Earned grades 25.73/30(HD).<br>
